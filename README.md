# WeVlogr

[![N|Solid](https://d14xs1qewsqjcd.cloudfront.net/assets/logo-black.svg)](https://www.meteor.com/)

WeVlogr is a meteor framework, mobile-ready, video sharing community. We take advantage of React & MongoDB technologies to accomplish this.

  - User Authentication
  - Authenticated users can upload videos and comment on videos.
  - Enjoy!

# Features!

  - Unathenticated users can browse all the video categories
  - Authenticated users can create customizable profiles and upload/edit content


You can also:
  - Authnticate with oAuth from social media platforms (Google, Twitter, etc)
  - User can subscribe to user created channels, recent activity on subscriptions is watched and updated
  - UpVote and DownVote videos. This will be used to calculate Trending videos.

WeVlogr is a video social media platform markup that will allows our users to post content without fear of being censored.

> The overriding design goal for Wevlogr
> is to make it as easy as possible.
>  for content to be shared without
> fear of censorship

Using a React & Meteor approach we hope to use Javascript to the fullest provide a speedy app to our users. The benfit of using Javascript end will allow us access to the Meteor and NPM package managers and ecosytems.

### Tech

WeVlogr uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Atom Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Meteor] - End to End Javascript Framework
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [NPM] - the streaming build system
* [MongoDB] - an open-source, document database
* [jQuery] - duh

For the moment WeVlogr will itself be private repository on GitHub.
